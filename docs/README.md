## Features

> Notes about command format:
> - Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
>   e.g. in `todo NAME`, NAME is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.
> - DATE should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. `2023-10-31`.
> - Do not put spaces in front of any commands.
> - Parameters should be separated by a single space.
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as list and bye) will be ignored.
> - All indexes are 1-based, e.g. the first task is task 1, the second task is task 2, and so on.
